- 👋 Hi, I’m Emanuele. I currently work as a Communication Specialist in an italian Scale Up company.
- 👀 I’m a very curios person and now I am interested in learning and master web design.
- 🌱 Currently I can create simple websites and landing pages in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I'm currently learning JavaScript and JQuery. Next steps: React/Angular, GitHub
- 🤝 FreeCodeCamp and MDN Web Docs are my best tools for learning!
- My first projects are here on GitHub, even my personal website.
- 📫 How to reach me: @rappa94 on Twitter and Emanuele Rappa on LinkedIn
